### Description
This is one of my early game development projects.  
The game is a relaxing 2D merge experience focused on **fast food cooking**:
players merge ingredients to create complete meals across **10 levels**.

This project was mainly a learning experience where I practiced:
- Merge-based gameplay logic  
- Progression systems  
- Integration with the Yandex Games SDK  

The code is preserved in its original state as part of my personal development history.

### Status
🗃️ **Legacy / Archive project**  
No active development — kept for documentation and personal growth tracking.
